# Inverse-Kinematics-Sim
This project will use different machine learning algorithms and apply them to solving the inverse kinematics problem in robotics, and evaluate how effective each of these algorithms are.

## How to run
All the dependencies are found in the requirements.txt, and are installed in the `projectEnv` virtual environment. You can activate by running:

`.\projectEnv\Scripts\activate` on windows
or
`source .\projectEnv\Scripts\activate` on Unix or macOS

To deactivate, the command is `deactivate`.
