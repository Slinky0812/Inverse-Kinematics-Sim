# Inverse-Kinematics-Sim
This project will use different machine learning algorithms and apply them to solving the inverse kinematics problem in robotics, and evaluate how effective each of these algorithms are.

## How to run
All the dependencies are found in the requirements.txt, which can be installed via the command line:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run this project, the command is:

`python main.py`
