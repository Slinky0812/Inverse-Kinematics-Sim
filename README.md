# Inverse-Kinematics-Sim
This project will use different machine learning algorithms and apply them to solving the inverse kinematics problem in robotics, and evaluate how effective each of these algorithms are using metrics like their Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score, and Pose Error values.
